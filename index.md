# The Digital Equity Coalition Aotearoa (DECA) 


### Te Reo Māori version coming soon 


## What is this page about?

Welcome!  This page contains some information about an initiative we are calling the Digital Equity Coalition Aotearoa or DECA. This is a working name; we are right at the beginning of thinking about and kicking off this initiative, and this page is the place where we will post updates and information about our progress as we move this thing forward.

“We” are a small group of people from different organisations who have come together to think about how those of us who care about and/or work in digital equity in Aotearoa might better coordinate our efforts.

If you care about and/or work in digital equity too, we hope you will keep an eye on what we are doing, reach out to us if you want to, and get involved with this initiative as it starts to gain momentum.

Read on below for some background, to find out more about what we are thinking, what we are planning, and how you might be able to get involved.


## Digital Equity in Aotearoa


### What is digital inclusion/digital equity? 


Digital equity exists when everyone can access and effectively use digital technologies so as to participate in our society, democracy and economy. Digital equity is our ultimate goal.


Digital inclusion refers to the initiatives and activities we undertake as we work towards digital equity. Digital inclusion is the means to achieve the goal. 


### What does digital equity look like?


A good resource for understanding digital exclusion in New Zealand is the Out of the Maze report at [https://report.digitaldivides.nz/](https://report.digitaldivides.nz/).


There is also a lot of good information on the Department of Internal Affairs’ webpage: [https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/digital-transformation/digital-inclusion/](https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/digital-transformation/digital-inclusion/)


The Out of the Maze report indicated that digital inclusion requires these things:



*   Access to connectivity and an appropriate device (including affordability, accessibility and convenience)
*   Skills to be able to do what you want online
*   Motivation to get online to connect, communicate and create
*   Trust so you feel safe participating online


### Why is digital equity important? 


COVID-19 has increased the reliance of New Zealanders on the Internet for work and study, information and entertainment, social interaction and commerce.  


It has also brought into sharper focus the reality that many New Zealanders are excluded from the digital world.  


Digital equity is a key part of our national response to COVID-19, but is also important as a foundation for the longer term wellbeing and economic prosperity of New Zealanders.


Often it is those New Zealanders who might have the most to gain from the Internet that are the ones who face the highest barriers. This includes families on low incomes, seniors, Māori, Pasifika, those with disabilities, and our remote communities. Digital engagement can play a significant role in improving social outcomes and individual wellbeing through opportunities available in the digital world.


And with more services (particularly government services) going exclusively online, people who are not able to access those services are becoming increasingly disadvantaged. 


### What is the digital inclusion ecosystem?

You might notice we use this term a bit below.

This is the term we use to describe all the people and organisations that care about and/or work in digital equity in Aotearoa. This includes actors, players, doers, supporters, allies, funders, champions, mentors, infrastructure and so on.


## The Five Point Plan for digital inclusion: COVID-19 and beyond

Earlier this year we were involved in the release of a five point plan that identified key digital inclusion priorities for cross-government action. More than 50 organisations have so far signed on to pledge their support in achieving these goals.

You can read the five point plan [here](https://internetnz.nz/policy/the-five-point-plan-for-digital-inclusion-covid-19-and-beyond) and a blog which explains a little more about it [here](https://internetnz.nz/blog/five-point-plan-digital-inclusion-covid-19-and-beyond/).   


## The problem: a lack of coordination

There are currently numerous organisations in the digital inclusion ecosystem in New Zealand, but we are quite fragmented and disconnected. 

During the discussions on the five point plan, we took the opportunity to ask the digital inclusion ecosystem what they thought about coordination. We heard that folks would like to see greater coordination in the ecosystem, specifically:



*   People want an awareness and understanding of **who is out there and what they are doing** so that there is synergy rather than competition and duplication in the ecosystem; and
*   People think we need to **work together to achieve some things** by contributing our networks, resources and skills towards actioning agreed priorities. 

There are also gaps in the ecosystem. Are the voices of all those affected by digital inequity being heard and represented?


## A proposed solution: radical cooperation

We are looking to establish a coalition which will bring the digital inclusion ecosystem together to share information, develop goals, identify priority initiatives, and drive and fund collaborative action to achieve digital equity in New Zealand. 

Its working name is the Digital Equity Coalition Aotearoa - DECA.

We recognise that if the DECA is to be effective, it needs to be inclusive, representative and diverse, therefore we want the process to set it up to be an inclusive one. We are currently working on that process - watch this space.

We are currently thinking about what the purpose or function of the DECA will be, and how we might structure the coalition. We will be looking to test these ideas and seek input more widely, but below are some preliminary thoughts. 

Some ideas about what the function of DECA could be:



*   A way to connect different groups in the digital inclusion ecosystem/create a digital inclusion network, so we can work together to achieve synergy and efficacy and avoid competition and duplication. 
*   A way to coordinate nationally in terms of identifying a few key specific goals/priorities/things that will shift the dial on digital equity and fund and drive towards those things collectively.
*   A better way to facilitate funding of digital inclusion initiatives.
*   A central port to connect into government for information exchange and collaboration.
*   A way to work together in strength to engage in advocacy on digital equity issues.

Some ideas on how we might structure the coalition:  



*   A diverse and representative Steering Group to set strategic direction, identify key goals and mobilise resources to achieve those, cultivate ecosystem engagement, engage with government and so on...
*   A constellation structure where highly active members of the ecosystem come up with initiatives and drive those initiatives, and other members of the community will coalesce around those initiatives for better efficiency and effectiveness.  See: [https://glenpricegroup.com/constellation-model-networking-social-change/](https://glenpricegroup.com/constellation-model-networking-social-change/)
*   A Secretariat to provide backbone support and coordination.
*   A wider membership.


## How you can be involved


### Join our contact list

As we work through this idea of a coalition we would love to involve others who care about digital equity. We have started a shared contact list as an initial attempt to help folks find out what is happening in the digital equity community, and make connections. 

We’re also planning to use the contact list to get in touch with folks as the DECA idea shapes up.  

If you’d like to sign up to the list, you can email your details to [policy@internetnz.net.nz](mailto:poliy@internetnz.net.nz) 


### Share your initiative

If you have a digital equity initiative, or an idea for one that you think might fit with the coalition we are building, we’d love you to keep this emerging coalition in mind.  

Do you have an existing initiative that you want others in the ecosystem to know about? Join our contact list (above) so we can keep in contact with you on a couple of other related initiatives, including a new digital inclusion website.

Could your initiative eventually form a “constellation” and attract other members to share their time, money, expertise and/or experience? Keep this in mind, in case it informs how you set up your initiative, and keep in touch so that you can be part of DECA once it is established.


### Potential funders please keep in touch

If you are a funder who is looking at funding digital inclusion, keep in touch as we will be working up different options for how you can be involved.

Funders who are supporting the establishment of this initiative are InternetNZ, Spark Foundation and Todd Foundation.


### Government agencies, we’d love to chat

We will be thinking about how this coalition can connect into government.

If you are in government, please feel free to get in touch - we’d love to understand what your particular part of government is doing on digital inclusion, and meet for coffee to tell you more about the coalition.  


## Keep an eye on this page

We will be adding updates as this initiative progresses - check out [the links to the right].

Thanks for your interest
